# RuneScape Clan Management
A web application for individual clan management in RuneScape. The purpose of this application is to be able to have an overview of your clan, clan members, their levels and experience etc. Furthermore, you will be able to have a level of management on the website such as posting news, events or articles related to your clan. There will also be tracking of events in-game related to clan members such as achievements,rare drops and hiscores to make clan members able to compete with eachother via the web application. With this you will also be able to have an easy way to promote you clan both in-game and on the internet.

In the future, this project will also migrate over to Old School RuneScape serving the same services as provided in this version. As Old School RuneScape does not have the same functional API as RuneScape, there will be developed a plugin to the open-source client RuneLite. This plugin will function as a data-grabber, and will open potential for developing even more advanced functionality than the original RuneScape API such as loot data, boss kills data and much more.
